# MDP-Algorithm
<i>Disclaimer - This repository was submitted as part of the CZ3004 - Multidisciplinary Project course at Nanyang Technological University and is no longer maintained.</i>

This repository contains code to achieve autonomous exploration of a 2D maze using a robot. Following an exploration phase, the robot is capable of going from a predefined start zone to an end zone in the shortest possible path. The code uses a left wall hugging algorithm to explore the maze and uses the Djikstra's greedy algorithm. The repository contains two branches. The master branch can be used to run the algorithm in a live set up. The simulator branch can be used to run the simulation.
